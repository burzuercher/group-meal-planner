        </p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
            The app allows tracking party sizes (including children count), but this is just a number
            for meal planning purposes and is not personally identifiable information about specific children.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact
            us immediately at groupmenuplanner@gmail.com, and we will delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Account Linking and Cross-Device Access</h2>
        <p>
            By default, your account is anonymous and tied to your device. If you choose to link your
            account with an email and password:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your anonymous account is upgraded to a permanent account</li>
            <li>You can sign in from any device using your email and password</li>
            <li>Your data synchronizes across all devices where you sign in</li>
            <li>Your email is stored securely and not shared with other users</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
            Menu images are generated using Google Gemini AI. When generating an image:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only the menu title (e.g., "Thanksgiving Dinner") is sent to the AI</li>
            <li>No personal information is included in AI requests</li>
            <li>Generated images are stored in Firebase Storage</li>
            <li>Images are visible to all members of the group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            AI-generated images are clearly labeled in the app with "Image created with AI" text.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            If you enable notifications, we use local notifications (scheduled on your device) to
            remind you about upcoming meals. These notifications:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are created and stored locally on your device</li>
            <li>Are not sent through external servers</li>
            <li>Do not track your behavior or location</li>
            <li>Respect your quiet hours settings (default: 10 PM - 8 AM)</li>
            <li>Can be disabled at any time in app settings or system settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices
            or legal requirements. When we make significant changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Last Updated" date at the top will be changed</li>
            <li>You will be notified through the app or via email (if you linked your account)</li>
            <li>Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
        </p>
